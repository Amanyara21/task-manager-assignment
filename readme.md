# Task Management Website

This project is a Task Management Website with a client and server setup. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main folders:
- `client`: Contains the frontend React application.
- `server`: Contains the backend Node.js/Express application.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:
- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (Node package manager, comes with Node.js)

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Amanyara21/task-manager-assignment
cd task-manager-assignment
```

### Running the Client

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `client` folder:

    ```sh
    cd client
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

   This will start the React development server on `http://localhost:5173/`.

### Running the Server

1. Open another terminal and navigate to the `server` folder:

    ```sh
    cd server
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```sh
